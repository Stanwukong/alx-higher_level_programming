# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Learning objectives for this project:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions


## Tasks
 - **0-square_matrix_simple.py**
	 - Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
	 - Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):`
	 - `matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
	 - Returns a new matrix:
		 - Same size as `matrix`
		 - Each value should be the square of the value of the input
		 - Initial matrix should not be modified
		 - You are not allowed to import any module
		 - You are allowed to use regular loops, `map`, etc.

 - **1-search_replace.py**
	 - Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
	 - Prototype: `def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):`
	 - `my_list` is the initial list
	 - `search` is the element to replace in the list
	 - `replace` is the new element
	 - You are not allowed to import any module

 - **2-uniq_add.py**
	 - Write a function that makes the addition of all unique integers in a list (only one time each integer).
	 - Prototype: `def uniq_add(my_list=[]):`
	 - You are not allowed to import any module

 - **3-common_elements.py**
	 - Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
	 - Prototype: `def common_elements(set_1, set_2):`
	 - You are not allowed to import any module
