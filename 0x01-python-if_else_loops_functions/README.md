## Tasks :page_curl:
- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
	- [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored is positive or negative.

- **1. The last digit**
	- [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py): This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored.

- **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
	- [2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py): This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

- **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
	- [3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py): This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line, except for the letters `q` and `e`.

- **4. Hexadecimal printing**
	- [4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py): This program prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.

- **5. 00...99**
	- [5-print_comb2.py](./5-print_comb2.py): This program prints numbers from `0` to `99` separated by `, `, in ascending order with two digits.

- **6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
	- [6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py): This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order with two digits.

- **7. islower**
	- [7-islower.py](./7-islower.py): This function checks for lowercase characters.

- **8. To uppercase**
	- [8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py): This function prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

- **9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
	- [9-print_last_digit.py](./9-print_last_digit.py): This function prints the last digit of a number.

- **10. a + b**
	- [10-add.py](./10-add.py): This function adds two integers and returns the result.

- **11. a ^ b**
	- [11-pow.py](./11-pow.py): This function computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.

- **12. Fizz Buzz**
	- [12-fizzbuzz.py](./12-fizzbuzz.py): This function prints the numbers from `1` to `100` separated by a space.
		- For multiples of three, `Fizz` is printed instead of the number.
		- For multiples of five, `Buzz` is printed instead of the number.
		- For multiples of both three and five, `FizzBuzz` is printed instead of the number.

- **13. Insert in sorted linked list**
	- [13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c): This function inserts a number into a sorted singly-linked list.
		- If the function fails, it returns `NULL`.
		- Otherwise, the function returns the address of the new node.

- **14. Smile in the mirror**
	- [100-print_tebahpla.py](./100-print_tebahpla.py): This program prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) not followed by a new line.

- **15. Remove at position**
	- [101-remove_char_at.py](./101-remove_char_at.py): This function creates a copy of a string, removing the character at the position `n` (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
		- If `n` is negative or out of range, the function returns the original string.
		- Otherwise, the function returns the new string.

- **16. ByteCode -> Python #2**
	- [102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py): This function matches exactly a Python bytecode provided by ALX.
